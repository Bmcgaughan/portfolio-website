                The What Do I Watch? site aims to answer the ever present
                question of what do we watch tonight? The app shows what is
                trending each week based on TMDB, and allows users to ‘favorite’
                shows that they like. It will also recommend shows based on a
                users favorites, and what other users have liked. It will also
                provide brief descriptions of the shows as well as what
                streaming service or network it is on.

              <p>
                The app was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React
                and Node.js). The purpose was to build a responsive and
                interactive site and learn this tech stack at the same time.

              <p>
                A constant question in our house is ‘what do we watch tonight?’
                This question has led to a lot of aimless searching on streaming
                apps for a new show to watch - and often settling on a less than
                ideal show.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since the beginning of Covid people have spent a lot more time
                streaming shows and discussing the shows they are watching. A
                recurring topic of conversation when we see friends is ‘what are
                you guys watching?’. When they do suggest shows we then have to
                figure out what streaming service it is on.
              </p>
              <p>
                This app aims to provide a friendly place for friends to share
                recommendations and find new content - and to answer the
                question: what do I watch?

                To create the back-end for the site - I created RESTful APIs
                using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The APIs allow the site to
                pull details about each show for display, flag shows that are
                currently trending, and allow users to store their favorite
                shows so the site can provide recommendations. The back-end will
                also poll The Movie Database API every 6 hours to pull the top
                trending shows and add them to my database and site.

            <div class="image-wrapper case-img">
              <img

                src="./img/wdiw_trend.png"
                alt="What do I Watch?"

            <div class="case-para">
              <p>
                The Client side was built using React and Redux - and is meant
                to provide the user with a responsive and intuitive interface so
                they can search for shows, read descriptions, and add shows to
                their list of favorites. The site initially shows the user a
                list of currently trending TV, as well as some recommendations
                based on their favorites.
              </p>
              <p>
                The user can click on any show to view some basic details
                including a description, actors, and directors. They can also
                choose to see other shows in the same genre or query TMDB for
                similar shows. At any point they can click the heart on the
                movie poster to add that show to their list of favorites.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally - you can search the database for any show by name, and
                if it is not in my database you can query TMDB.

                I did all of the development work on the project. Throughout the
                project I was assisted by my tutor Matthew and my mentor
                Jonatan. They provided valuable insight into different ways to
                approach problems - as well as suggestions on how to structure
                the site. I gathered all of the data for the shows using APIs
                provided by -
                <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/" target="_blank">
                  <img

              <p>
                I also leveraged the Swiper.js library to generate responsive
                carousels for the site's landing page
